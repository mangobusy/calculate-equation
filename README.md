# calculate-equation

There are two files in this app:

     1. assessment2.py
          
          There are two 'class':
     
               1. Stack class
     
               2. BinaryTree class
     
               3. Call_func class

     There are five functions:
     
          1. buile_tree function: it is used to build a tree of the input expression
     
          2. evaluate function: it is used to calculate the result
     
          3. print_exampleTree function: it is used to visualise the generated binary tree
     
          4. is_matched: it is used to determine whether brackets are matched
     
          5. is_valid: it is used to determine wether the expression is valid
     
     2. unit_test.py
     


How to use this app:
  
  first input an equation (no matter it is valid or not vaild).

      if it is valid: it will print out the result and the Tree of this equation

      if it is not valid: it will not give you the result, and it will tell you the reason why it is not valid
